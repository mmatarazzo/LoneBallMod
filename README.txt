This is a slightly modified version of the sample project "LoneBall" which accompanies the book 
"The Beginner's Guide to Android Game Development" by James S. Cho.

It adds two player capability by implementing independently controlled paddles and keeping a 
score for each player, draws a circular ball, and randomizes the initial x-direction of the ball.

The original README by James S. Cho is below. The original MIT License is also included.
